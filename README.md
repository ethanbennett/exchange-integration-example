### Exchange integration example

This is a basic React app (created with `create-react-app`) that imports `@makerdao/exchange-integration-poc`, initializes a new `Maker` object, and uses it for basic CDP functionality.

The only relevant code is in `App.js`, unless you want to run it yourself, in which case you can simply clone this repo, `npm install`, and `npm start`.
